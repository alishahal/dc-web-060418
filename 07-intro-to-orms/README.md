# Intro to ORMS


## The world so far

  * Tweet.rb defines the class Tweet, which has the attributes of a `message` body and `belongs_to` a User object
  * User.rb defines a `User` object which has a Username and an array of Tweets
  * Like.rb is a class defining a `join` table which connects many Users to many Tweets
  * Each class has class and instance methods to give us access to CRUD functionality
  * We have no way to make data persist between sessions
