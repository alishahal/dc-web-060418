## Designing a Project and Thinking in React
- Planning and drawing boxes around everything
- Component Hierarchy
- Organizing our Code
- Build Static Components

## Props
- Props are passed to other components and can only flow down (passed from parent)
- What does the props object look like?
- Like parameters to the function
- Should be read only

## Object Destructuring

```
let obj = {a: "aVar", b: "bye"}
let {a, b} = obj
//a => "aVar"
//b => "bye"
```
