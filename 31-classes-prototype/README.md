# Object Oriented Javascript
- Javascript Under the hood
- ES5
- ES6

## Why object oriented programming?
- models the real world
- method reference (group both data and behavior)
- readable?
```
person.greet()
// 'hi'
greet(person);
// 'hi'
```

## Object Creation Patterns
- literal
 - {}
- Factory pattern
- `new` Object

## `new` and Constructor calls

## Prototype Chain, and `__proto__`

## Parts of an Object
- Attributes (instance variables)
- Class variables
- Methods (call some function associated with the object)
  - Instance methods - behavior of one of these kinds of objects
  - Class methods - behavior associated with the whole class

## `class` syntax
- They are not hoisted

## Object inheritance and Object relationships
