# Advanced Redux: Action Creators and Thunk

## Objectives

- Introduce Action Creators as a pattern
- Introduce redux-thunk
- Practice with combineReducers

## Questions

- When to keep state in React components (vs. in Redux)?
  - When only the component needs that state
- How to change just one element in an array? (good patterns?)
  - (append) `[...state, newobject]`;
  - just one key of an object?
  - (without mutating the original)

What's an action creator?
