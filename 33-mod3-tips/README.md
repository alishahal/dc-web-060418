## Restate the problem
- for an array of arrays,
- for each nested array, find the max and min nums, get their difference
- then add them up



## Look for potential edge cases
- negative values
- one element either in nested array or in top level arrays
- no elements in array (or nested arrays)



## Pseudocode/First Attempt
