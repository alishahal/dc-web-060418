# React-Redux

## Objectives

- Walk through implementing the redux and react-redux libraries
- Learn how to set up the boilerplate of react-redux with Provider
- Use state inside the redux store in a component with connect and mapStateToProps
- Convert a function passed down as a prop to a child component into an action passed in through mapDispatchToProps

## Problems

How do we structure the store?
- Does it get its own file?
- What about the Reducer?

One giant reducer function
  - super messy
  - we want to separate it into smaller pieces

Component does not rerender when store state is updated
  - it would be cool if store state was a prop to our component
  - like to remove our bad hack

## Provider

## Connect

## mapStateToProps

## mapDispatchToProps

## File structure

## combineReducers
