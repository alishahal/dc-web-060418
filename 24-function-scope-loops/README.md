# Functions

## Functions as First-Class Citizens

## How can we write them?
- what are the differences in syntax and features

## Functions and the Execution Stack
- how the JS engine keeps track of where in the program we are at
```
const functionExpression = function(){console.log("inside a function expression")}

function functionName(){
	return "hey"
}

// let arrowFunction = () => {
// 	console.log("hello from inside an arrow function")
// }

```

- Declarations make use of Hoisting
- Expressions are needed in certain cases where one instance of the function should exist

- Hoisting

# Scope
- where a variable is born, lives, and dies

## What is Scope?
- var vs. let vs. const
- global vs. functional vs. block
- Lexical Scoping
- Scope Chain

# Loops
- for
- for...in
- for...of
- .forEach()
- map, find, filter, reduce, and sort array methods

## Callback Functions
