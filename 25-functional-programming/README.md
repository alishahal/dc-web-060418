## Higher Order Functions and Functional Programming

### Take another function as a parameter
 - Callbacks

### Return a Function
 - Function Factories

### Be Nested
 - Closures

### Run once and only once
- IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)

## Functional Programming (vs. Object Oriented Programming)
 - Pure Functions
 - Does not mutate state, affecting global variables or other parts of the program
 - Declarative code
 - Each function does one thing
